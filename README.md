MyLake C (2018)

Written by Petri Kiuru (petri.j.kiuru@jyu.fi)

This version of MyLake includes novel descriptions of dissolved oxygen and organic carbon (with 3 pools of DOC and 2 pools of POC) as well as a description of dissolved organic carbon species. The version is partly based on MyLake DOCOMO (see https://github.com/biogeochemistry/MyLake-v2.0 ; requires login).

The folders vC and air_sea contain the model code for MyLake C. The folder vC_gases contains the additional code for a model extension that includes four alternative formulations for gas transfer velocity.

This version has no manual.  The MyLake C model is presented in the following article:
